# Beyond Descriptors: Leveraging Experimental Metadata in QSAR Prediction

## ðŸ§ª Motivation

Traditional QSAR models rely on molecular descriptors alone, often ignoring critical experimental conditions like cell type, assay format, or readout type. We believe these signals can help capture meaningful biological relationships between chemical structures and their measured activities.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

To improve the prediction of small molecule bioactivity (IC50) by augmenting traditional descriptor-based QSAR models with embeddings generated from experimental metadata.
